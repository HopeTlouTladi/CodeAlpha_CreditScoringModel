# CodeAlpha_CreditScoringModel
Credit Scoring Model Using Machine Learning Project Overview  This project focuses on building a credit scoring system that predicts whether a customer is creditworthy or risky. The objective is to support better lending decisions by reducing financial risk while maintaining fair approval rates.
Objectives
Prepare and explore the dataset
Train classification models (Logistic Regression and XGBoost)
Evaluate performance using confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC
Compare models and interpret results
Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Scikit-learn
XGBoost
Matplotlib
Model Training
Two models are trained for comparison:

Logistic Regression: A simple and interpretable baseline model.
XGBoost: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm that captures complex relationships.
Model Evaluation
Performance is evaluated using:

Classification report
Confusion matrix
ROC curve
AUC score
These metrics help assess predictive quality beyond accuracy alone.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to credit risk prediction. Logistic Regression provided a strong baseline with interpretability, while XGBoost captured complex patterns and often improved predictive performance. Model evaluation using ROC–AUC and confusion matrices helped assess classification quality beyond accuracy alone
